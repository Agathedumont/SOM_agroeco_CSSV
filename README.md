🔍 Reproducibility disclaimer
This project, as currently published, is not fully reproducible because the dataset from the C4F project is not publicly available. However, the code and workflow can still serve as a source of inspiration and can be adapted to your own data.
 
🚀 How to use this repository?
- You can replace the missing dataset with your own data and follow the same workflow.
- The functions available in the .R directory can be reused in different contexts.
- If the C4F dataset becomes available in the future, this repository will be updated accordingly.
